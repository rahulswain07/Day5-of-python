🐍 Day 5 – Python Challenge
Topic: Lists and Tuples

Today I learned about two important data types in Python: list and tuple.

✅ What I Learned:
How to create lists and tuples

Accessing elements using indexing and slicing

Lists are mutable (we can change them)

Tuples are immutable (we can’t change them)

List methods: append(), insert(), pop(), remove(), sort(), etc.

Tuple packing and unpacking

🔁 Practice:
Wrote examples using list and tuple operations

Solved small problems to understand mutability

Compared list vs tuple with simple use cases

🧠 Key Takeaway:
Use lists when data needs to change. Use tuples for fixed data.
Lists = flexible, Tuples = safe and fast.
