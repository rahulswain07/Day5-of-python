🐍 Day 5 – Python Challenge
Topic: Lists and Tuples

Today I learned about two important data types in Python: list and tuple.

✅ What I Learned:
How to create lists and tuples

Accessing elements using indexing and slicing

Lists are mutable (we can change them)

Tuples are immutable (we can’t change them)

List methods: append(), insert(), pop(), remove(), sort(), etc.

Tuple packing and unpacking

🔁 Practice:
Wrote examples using list and tuple operations

Solved small problems to understand mutability

Compared list vs tuple with simple use cases

🧠 Key Takeaway:
Use lists when data needs to change. Use tuples for fixed data.
Lists = flexible, Tuples = safe and fast.

Great question, Rahul! Here's the difference:

✅ Where to write this?
🔹 If you're updating your GitHub repository homepage:
Write it in the README.md file.

This is the best place to track your daily progress and show it to visitors.

Add each day's update under a new heading like ## Day 5.

🔹 If you're just making a Git commit:
Write a short version in the commit message, like:

Day 5: Learned about Lists and Tuples in Python

✍️ Recommendation:
Yes — write the full description in your README.md
✅ It looks more professional
✅ Easy for others (and your future self) to follow your journey
✅ You can pin the repo on your GitHub profile to show progress

Would you like a sample README.md structure for your 100-day challenge repo?
